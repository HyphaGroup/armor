# Reset Threat Model Framework

The workshop is designed to help us identify their critical assets, potential threats, vulnerabilities, and risks. The work is divided into four sections: Asset Identification, Threat Identification, Vulnerability Assessment, and Risk Analysis. The workshop can be completed as a group in a single session, in multiple sessions, or asynchronously with a group or individually in a digital workspace.

## Pre-Workshop Preparation

### Required Materials

- Large whiteboard or digital workspace
- Sticky notes (3 colors)
- Our organization’s mission statement
- List of critical services/programs
- Basic IT infrastructure diagram
- Recent incident reports (if any)

### Participant Preparation

- A brief overview of our organization's digital and physical assets
- List of known security concerns
- Recent changes in operations or technology
- Current security measures in place

## Workshop Structure (3-4 hours)

### 1\. Asset Identification (45 mins)

**Key Questions:**

- What do we need to protect?
- What would hurt our mission if compromised?

**Process:**

1. List all assets in categories:

  - People (staff, volunteers, beneficiaries)
  - Data (personal information, financial records, donor data)
  - Systems (computers, networks, cloud services)
  - Physical assets (offices, equipment)
  - Reputation and relationships

**Output:** Prioritized asset list with impact ratings (High/Medium/Low)

### 2\. Threat Identification (60 mins)

**Key Questions:**

- Who might want to harm us?
- What are their motivations?
- What could go wrong accidentally?

**Process:**

1. Map potential adversaries and their motivations:

  - Hacktivists opposing our mission
  - Nation-state actors targeting our work
  - Insiders (disgruntled employees/volunteers)
  - Competitors or opposing organizations
  - Opportunistic attackers
  - Cybercriminals seeking financial gain
  - For each actor, document:

    - Their resources and capabilities
    - Historical patterns of behavior
    - Likely targeting priorities and goals
2. Brainstorm threats using the STRIDE model:

  - Spoofing (impersonation)
  - Tampering (unauthorized changes)
  - Repudiation (denying actions)
  - Information disclosure (data leaks)
  - Denial of service (disruption)
  - Elevation of privilege (unauthorized access)
3. Consider both intentional and accidental threats:

  - Natural disasters
  - Human error
  - Technical failures
  - Malicious actors

**Output:** Comprehensive threat list with likelihood ratings (High/Medium/Low)

### 3\. Vulnerability Assessment (45 mins)

**Key Questions:**

- Where are we weak?
- What could our adversaries exploit?
- What safeguards are missing?

**Process:**

1. Create an asset-threat matrix:

  1. List assets vertically (e.g., donor database, office building, staff devices)
  2. List threats horizontally (e.g., hacking, theft, natural disasters)
  3. Mark intersections where threats could affect assets
2. For each marked asset-threat pair, identify:

  - Existing protections
  - Known weaknesses, gaps in protections
  - Missing controls
  - Potential impact if exploited

**Output:** Vulnerability matrix linking threats to assets

### 4\. Risk Analysis (45 mins)

**Key Questions:**

- Which risks matter most?
- What's the potential impact?
- How likely is it to happen?

**Risk Definition:** Risk = (Asset Value × Threat Likelihood × Vulnerability Severity)

A risk exists when three elements combine:

- A valuable asset identified in Section 1
- A viable threat identified in Section 2
- An exploitable vulnerability identified in Section 3

Example:

- Asset: Donor database (high value)
- Threat: Cybercriminal (medium likelihood)
- Vulnerability: Weak password policy (high severity)
- **_Resulting Risk: There is a high risk of unauthorized access to donor information._**

**Process:**

1. Generate Risk Scenarios: Write out specific risk scenarios using this format for each asset-threat-vulnerability combination identified earlier. This is a more is more exercise. For example:

  - "There is a risk that \[threat actor/event\] could exploit \[vulnerability\] to \[harmful outcome\] affecting \[asset\], which would impact \[mission/operations\]."
  - "There is a risk that cybercriminals could exploit weak passwords to gain unauthorized access to our donor database, which would impact donor trust and fundraising capabilities."
  - "There is a risk that natural disasters could exploit our lack of backup systems to destroy critical program data, which would impact service delivery."
  - "There is a risk that disgruntled employees could exploit excessive system privileges to leak sensitive information, which would impact our reputation and partnerships."
  - For each risk scenario, consider:

    - Is it specific and clear?
    - Can we identify the cause?
    - Is the impact tangible?

      - Financial impact
      - Mission Impact
      - Reputational damage
      - Legal/compliance issues
    - Is it within our scope?
    - Is it actionable?
2. Score each Risk Scenario:

  - **Impact Levels:**

    - High (3): Severe disruption to mission, major financial loss, significant reputation damage
    - Medium (2): Moderate disruption, recoverable financial impact, limited reputation damage
    - Low (1): Minor inconvenience, minimal financial impact, no lasting reputation damage
  - **Likelihood Levels:**

    - High (3): Expected to occur within 1 year / Known active threats
    - Medium (2): Could occur within 1-2 years / Some indicators of threat
    - Low (1): Unlikely within 2+ years / No current indicators
  - **Calculation Method:**

    1. Multiply Impact score (1-3) × Likelihood score (1-3)
    2. Results in risk scores from 1-9:

      - 7-9: Critical Risk (Red) - Immediate action required
      - 4-6: Significant Risk (Yellow) - Plan needed soon
      - 1-3: Moderate Risk (Green) - Monitor and review

**Output:** Prioritized register of Risk Scenarios

### 5\. Mitigation Planning (45 mins)

**Key Questions:**

- What can we do about each risk?
- What resources do we need?
- Who's responsible?

**Process:**

1. For each high-priority risk, develop:

  - Immediate actions (next 30 days)
  - Short-term improvements (90 days)
  - Long-term solutions (6-12 months)
2. Assign owners and deadlines.

**Output:** Action plan with timeline and responsibilities

## Post-Workshop Activities

### Documentation

1. Compile findings into:

  - Executive summary
  - Detailed risk register
  - Action plan
  - Resource requirements

### Follow-up Schedule

1. Monthly review of high-priority actions
2. Quarterly progress updates
3. Annual threat model refresh

### Success Metrics

1. Number of incidents prevented/mitigated
2. Percentage of actions completed
3. Staff security awareness improvement
4. Time to detect/respond to incidents

## Facilitation Tips

- Use simple, non-technical language.
- Encourage participation from all attendees.
- Use real examples from the nonprofit sector.
- Focus on mission impact
- Document assumptions
- Keep scope manageable

## Common Pitfalls to Avoid

- Getting too technical too quickly
- Focusing only on cyber threats
- Ignoring human factors
- Making unrealistic action plans
- Skipping documentation
